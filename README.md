# probability_abtest_regression

1. Introduction

This project uses three methods (probability, A/B testing and a regression model) to test whether an e-commerce new website landing page leads to more 
users converting into members than their current ('old') page.

In addition, the project will test whether a user's country of residence has an effect on conversion.

2. Conclusions

The project has found no evidence that:
- the new landing page leads to more user conversions, or
- the user's country of residence affects conversion, 

Therefore, the company should keep the old page in all its countries of operation.
